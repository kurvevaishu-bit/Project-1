# AI-Based Paper Corrector System

An AI-powered system to automatically evaluate descriptive answer sheets using OCR and NLP techniques. This project reduces manual grading effort and improves consistency in evaluation.

## Abstract
This project presents an AI-powered system for evaluating descriptive answer sheets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and keyword-based scoring. Teachers upload images of answer sheets, which are processed using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text. The system analyzes answers using keyword matching and semantic similarity to assess correctness. It compares responses with predefined answer keys and assigns marks based on relevance and completeness. This solution reduces manual effort, improves consistency, and enables efficient automated grading.

## 1. Introduction

In educational institutions, evaluating descriptive answer sheets is a time-consuming and subjective task. Teachers often spend hours checking answers, which can lead to fatigue and inconsistent grading. Automating this process using AI and machine learning can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy.

Unlike MCQ-based systems, descriptive answer evaluation requires understanding text meaning, keyword importance, and answer completeness. By integrating OCR and NLP, the system can extract and analyze answers intelligently.

### Objectives:
- Extract text from answer sheet images using OCR
- Identify important keywords in student answers
- Compare answers with predefined answer keys
- Assign marks based on correctness and relevance
- Generate a detailed evaluation report

## 2. Literature Review

Automated grading systems have been widely studied using NLP and machine learning techniques.

- Systems using Tesseract OCR extract text from scanned documents with good accuracy.
- Research on automated essay scoring using BERT models shows improved semantic understanding.
- Keyword-based evaluation methods are widely used for short-answer grading.
- Deep learning models like transformers enhance contextual understanding compared to traditional methods.

However, most existing systems either focus only on objective answers or lack real-time feedback and personalization. This project combines OCR and NLP to provide a balanced and practical solution.

## 3. Methodology

The system accepts images of answer sheets as input. OCR is used to extract text from the images. The extracted text is preprocessed using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming. A keyword matching algorithm identifies important terms and compares them with the predefined answer key. Additionally, semantic similarity models evaluate the meaning of the answer beyond exact keywords. Marks are assigned based on keyword presence, relevance, and completeness. The system generates a final score along with feedback highlighting missing or incorrect concepts.
